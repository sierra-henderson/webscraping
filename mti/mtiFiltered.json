      "Grandson of the infamous Victor Frankenstein, Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced \"Fronk-en-steen\") inherits his family's estate in Transylvania. With the help of a hunchbacked sidekick, Igor (pronounced \"Eye-gore\"), and a leggy lab assistant, Inga (pronounced normally), Frederick finds himself in the mad scientist shoes of his ancestors. \"It's alive!\" he exclaims as he brings to life a creature to rival his grandfather's. Eventually, of course, the monster escapes and hilarity continuously abounds.",
      "Every bit as relevant to audience members who will remember the original as it will be to newcomers, Young Frankenstein has all the of panache of the screen sensation with a little extra theatrical flair added. It will surely be the perfect opportunity for a production company to showcase an array of talents. With such memorable tunes as \"The Transylvania Mania,\" \"He Vas My Boyfriend\" and \"Puttin' on the Ritz,\" Young Frankenstein is scientifically proven, monstrously good entertainment."

Thrown into a school where croquet is bigger than football, the school store sells much more than paper and pens, and lockers hold a lot more than books, Arthur finds that being “cool” is the only rule... and even eating lunch in the cafetorium is an ordeal. As he makes new friends (and a couple of enemies), Arthur learns to stand up for himself and helps others learn the importance of self-reliance and commitment to ones’ principles and passions.",
      "Filled with an assortment of characters that are based on Carroll's creations – like Principal Cheshire (who is often heard, but not seen); zany Matt Adder; April May (who had her hair done in March); Dora Mouskowitz (who can barely stay awake); Lily, Rose, Daisy and Violet (the Garden Glees – an all-girls a capella group); and Alice (of course!), Wonderland High features an energetic score and plenty of comedic, age-appropriate character roles. A large ensemble makes expanding the cast easy, and the high school setting makes scenery and costumes a breeze."

      "This boisterously hilarious, yet poignant, musical follows Dionysos, Greek god of wine and drama, and his slave, Xanthias, on a journey to Hades to collect renowned critic and playwright, George Bernard Shaw, so that he may enlighten the easily misled and coerced masses of Earth. Along this journey, Dionysus and Xanthias meet Chekhov, Congreve, Ibsen, Brecht and, of course, the chorus of frogs. Then, Shakespeare shows up and starts declaiming his greatest hits; before long, he engages in a battle of words with Mr. Shaw. Who will win the honor of becoming reincarnated: The Bard or Bernard?",
      "The Frogs stays true to its heritage, mixing Aristophanic pratfall satire with a Sondheim score that swings from witty to pretty to rambunctious, but it also mirrors the Greek original for the serious issue of the role of the arts in a world beset by war and folly. This musical is ideal for a regional theatre looking to inject a bit of Greek satire into its season."

But another relationship soon begins to develop in Jerusha’s life. Jervis Pendleton is the well-do-do, “youngish” uncle of one of Jerusha’s roommates, who introduces her to a world of literature, travel and adventure.

Along the way, he meets his wife, Rachel, takes on the Founding Fathers — and rocks like no political figure has ever rocked before, with the help of an onstage trio and an entourage of singing, joking cohorts. It also asks the question: is wanting to have a beer with someone reason enough to elect him? What if he's really, really hot?",

Hilariously funny and touchingly honest, Urinetown provides a fresh perspective on one of America's greatest art forms.",
      "In a Gotham-like city, a terrible water shortage, caused by a 20-year drought, has led to a government-enforced ban on private toilets. The citizens must use public amenities, regulated by a single malevolent company that profits by charging admission for one of humanity's most basic needs. Amid the people, a hero decides that he's had enough and plans a revolution to lead them all to freedom!",
      "Inspired by the works of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill, Urinetown is an irreverently humorous satire in which no one is safe from scrutiny. Praised for reinvigorating the very notion of what a musical could be, Urinetown catapults the \"comedic romp\" into the new millennium with its outrageous perspective, wickedly modern wit and sustained ability to produce gales of unbridled laughter."

Wintergreen, whose party, lacking a viable platform, runs on love, promising that if elected he will marry the partner chosen for him at an Atlantic City beauty pageant. When he falls for Mary Turner (a campaign secretary who bakes a mean corn muffin) instead of Diana Deveraux (the fairest flower of the South and winner of the pageant), trouble begins!\nWith politicians skewered right and left (including a Vice President who wanders the White House unrecognized by his own staff), Of Thee I Sing is an hilarious and timeless send-up of national institutions that is as relevant as ever. (It even features its own impeachment proceedings!) The extensive hit-filled score, one of the George and Ira Gershwin's finest creations, makes the show as suitable for concert presentation as full production."

Together, they confront history's timeless contradictions of wealth and poverty, freedom and prejudice, hope and despair... and what it means to live in America.",

Mal, Evie, Jay and Carlos – the children of Maleficent, the Evil Queen, Cruella De Vil, and Jafar – are welcomed to Auradon Prep to attend school with the children of their parents’ sworn enemies.

In the end, the show delivers a poignant message about the importance of the individual in a conformist society – but not before aiming its still-relevant barbs at government, religion, science and anything else that stands in its way!",

The recording comes to life and The Drowsy Chaperone begins as the man in the chair looks on. Mix in two lovers on the eve of their wedding, a bumbling best man, a desperate theatre producer, a not-so-bright hostess, two gangsters posing as pastry chefs, a misguided Don Juan and an intoxicated chaperone, and you have the ingredients for an evening of madcap delight.",
      "Hailed by New York Magazine as \"The Perfect Broadway Musical,\" The Drowsy Chaperone is a masterful meta-musical, poking fun at all the tropes that characterize the musical theatre genre. Because of its many featured roles and accessible script, The Drowsy Chaperone will fit perfectly into any company's season or school's calendar."

The landmark musical is an electrifying fusion of morality, sexuality and rock and roll that is exhilarating audiences across the nation like no other musical in years.",
      "It is Germany, 1891, a world where the grown-ups hold all the cards. The beautiful young Wendla explores the mysteries of her body and wonders aloud where babies come from... until Mama tells her to shut it and put on a proper dress. Elsewhere, the brilliant and fearless young Melchior interrupts a mind-numbing Latin drill to defend his buddy, Moritz – a boy so traumatized by puberty that he can't concentrate on anything... not that the Headmaster cares. He strikes them both and tells them to turn in their lesson. One afternoon, in a private place in the woods, Melchior and Wendla meet by accident and soon find within themselves a desire unlike anything they've ever felt. As they fumble their way into one another's arms, Moritz flounders and soon fails out of school. When even his one adult friend, Melchior's mother, ignores his plea for help, he is left so distraught that he can't hear the promise of life offered by his outcast friend, Ilse. Naturally, the Headmasters waste no time in pinning the \"crime\" of Moritz's suicide on Melchior to expel him. And soon, Mama learns that her little Wendla is pregnant. Now the young lovers must struggle against all odds to build a world together for their child.",

Featuring a pop rock score, this is an ideal show for talented vocalists with strong acting abilities. Join this group of late nineteenth century German students on their passage as the navigate teenage self-discovery and coming of age anxiety in a powerful celebration of youth and rebellion in the daring, remarkable Spring Awakening."

Featuring an infectious score by the Oscar- and Tony-winning team of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, Little Shop of Horrors), God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is a legendary collaboration between one of America's greatest novelists and the songwriting team behind some of the greatest hits of all time.",
      "Eliot Rosewater, drunk, volunteer fireman and president of the fabulously rich Rosewater Foundation, is about to attempt a noble experiment with human nature, with a little help from writer, Kilgore Trout. The result is Vonnegut's funniest satire, an etched-in-acid portrayal of the greed, hypocrisy and follies of the flesh to which we are all heir.",
      "Any fan of the music of Menken and Ashman will delight in producing this gem, which marked the first collaboration for the two. Full of unforgettable characters and a rich and hysterically funny story, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is a perfect choice for theatres that are looking for hidden greats of musical theatre.",

Adapted from Kurt Vonnegut's novella, it tells the story of Elliot Rosewater, the eccentric head of the Rosewater Foundation, son of Senator Rosewater, descendant of generations of wealthy and powerful Rosewater's, who finds in the poor and forgotten Americans in Rosewater Township, Indiana, the very people who most deserve his foundation's generosity. And that story struck a deep chord in both Howard and me. The fact that Kurt Vonnegut himself became creatively involved in our little musical was a total dream-come-true.",
      "If you look (and listen) carefully, the seeds of our later work are all over this musical. It was the cradle from which we emerged to write Little Shop of Horrors, The Little Mermaid and Aladdin . We lost Howard Ashman way too soon, or that list of titles would have been much longer. That makes it all the more meaningful to me that, nearly 40 years after its creation, God Bless You Mr Rosewater now joins those other titles out in the world.\""

His world view shattered, Javert commits suicide, and Valjean finally attains the peace that he has sought for so long.",

Frederic's melodious tones win over the heart of Major-General Stanley's songbird daughter, Mabel, but when the Pirate King discovers that General Stanley has lied about being an orphan to keep the pirates from stealing all of his belongings and carrying off his bevy of beautiful daughters, an \"ingenious paradox\" may prevent the budding romance and lead to the death of \"The very model of a modern Major-General.\"",

The sheer number of memorable roles makes it perfect for community and school groups. And with production requirements consisting of only two sets and a medium-sized orchestra, The Pirates of Penzance should be considered by any company featuring comic actors with excellent singing voices."

Add two pairs of star-crossed lovers, one very overbearing mother, a cagey government official and a strange man who always places himself in the right place at the most interesting times; mix them all together, and you are left with a side-splitting romp of cheese-y proportions!",

Performers and audience members alike will be chomping at the bit and, given the brilliance of the material, it can be produced just as effectively as a concert piece."

      "Winner of the Drama Critics' Circle Award and Lucille Lortel Award for Best Musical when it premiered Off-Broadway in 1997, and then on to a Tony-nominated Broadway debut in 2014 with a revised version, Violet is a moving musical featuring show-stopping anthems, ranging from American-roots to folk to gospel.  With a score from Tony-winning composer Jeanine Tesori (Caroline, or Change; Thoroughly Modern Millie; Shrek; Fun Home) and book and lyrics by the acclaimed Brian Crawley (A Little Princess), Violet is inspired by the short story, The Ugliest Pilgrim by Doris Betts, astounding critics and audiences alike in two separate decades.",
      "As a girl, Violet was struck by a wayward axe blade when her father was chopping wood, leaving her with a visible scar across her face. With enough money finally saved she's traveling across the Deep South in 1964 towards a miracle – the healing touch of a TV evangelist who will make her beautiful. Although she may not succeed in having the scar on her face healed, Violet is able to repair those scars that are lying deeper than her skin. On the way, she meets a young, African-American soldier whose love for her reaches far past her physical \"imperfections.\"",
      "Violet is a powerhouse piece of theatre that needs no more than a few chairs and talented performers to take an audience's breath away. It is a must for companies that are dedicated to depicting moving stories onstage."

Things really get interesting when Liz's dashing Duke turns out to be penniless. Happy Hunting features a gag-filled book and a delectable score, including the Merman classic, \"Mutual Admiration Society.\" In addition to the star role, this large cast gives opportunities to many female performers, including teenagers.

His business thrives and, with the help of a revolutionary named Kruger, he retakes the White House by force!",
      "Aiming its barbs at everything from totalitarianism to fashion shows, Let 'Em Eat Cake is a dark and cynical, yet, hilarious, American operetta featuring one of the Gershwins' most ambitious, forward-looking scores, making it a natural choice for concert presentation. Perfect for politically minded audiences, it's enjoyable as a sequel or on its own."

Along with Pepa, there's her missing (possibly philandering) lover, Ivan; his ex-wife of questionable sanity, Lucia; their son, Carlos; Pepa's friend, Candela  and her terrorist boyfriend; a power-suited lawyer; and a taxi driver who dispenses tissues, mints and advice in equal proportion.

This re-imagined version of the classic tale expands beyond the confines of Victorian England to Africa, giving the writers ample opportunity to include lively African music and dance, exotic locales like Mali and Timbuktu and creating an unforgettable journey around the world.",
      "Separated from her father and the openhearted Africans who have helped him raise her, young Sara Crewe is sent to boarding school in London. When things go badly for her there, her imaginative powers come to the rescue – helping to transform a drab institution into a place of magic and mystery. As the girl wins the affection of the other boarders, she draws the ire of Miss Minchin, the dour headmistress, who forces Sara to work as a maid when her father is reported dead, and his fortune is seized. Sara counters all of Miss Minchin's best efforts to degrade her, all the while maintaining the grace and virtue of a little princess.",
      "A Little Princess is a big show that calls for many younger female actresses, making it perfect for educational institutions. Because of its strong curriculum tie-ins, A Little Princess provides a wonderful opportunity for theatre companies to team up with schools in their area for workshops, talkbacks and more."

What begins as a night of boogie fever quickly changes to panic as the ship succumbs to multiple disasters, such as earthquakes, tidal waves and infernos.

      "What do you get when two musical theatre masters, Frank Loesser and George Abbott, adapt one of the most successful farces of all time? Where's Charley?, a tuneful comedy classic that earned lead actor Ray Bolger (of Wizard of Oz fame) a Tony Award and launched Loesser's career (Guys and Dolls)! George Abbot's book preserves all of the laughs from the record-breaking play, Charlie's Aunt, upon which the show is based.",
      "Oxford University students Charley and Jack invite the young and winsome Kitty and Amy to lunch under the chaperoning eye of Donna Lucia, Charley's wealthy aunt (it is, after all, 1892). But when Donna Lucia doesn't show, a desperate Charley disguises himself as his aunt so that the young ladies can visit. Charley is unaware that they've brought a chaperone of their own: Amy's stuffy uncle, who promptly falls for Charley's aunt-like charms! When the real aunt shows up, it's all downhill from there: quick changes, fast-talking, marriage proposals, compromising situations and rowdy hilarity.",
      "Where's Charley? offers a star turn for a talented leading man amongst a medium-sized cast. Featuring Loesser's critically acclaimed, but fairly obscure, score, Where's Charley? is a chance to introduce audiences to a classic Golden Age musical that they'll love, but that they probably haven't already heard, while keeping the interest of die-hard fans."

Bold, original, disturbing and alarmingly funny, Assassins is perhaps the most controversial musical ever written.",

From John Wilkes Booth to Lee Harvey Oswald, writers, Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman, bend the rules of time and space, taking us on a nightmarish roller coaster ride in which assassins and would-be assassins from different historical periods meet, interact and inspire each other to harrowing acts in the name of the American Dream."
