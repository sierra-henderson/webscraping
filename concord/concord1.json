The gentleman is an attractive, middle-aged shopkeeper, whose attentions give flight to her deepest dreams of romance. Too soon, however, he openly informs her that he is a contented family man, and Leona's hopes are dashed. She can, for a short time, harness romance, yet realizes that such a relationship would have nowhere to go. Still, might it be better than never having loved at all? This timeless story, whichwas also the basis of the movie Summertime starring Katharine Hepburn, remains a bittersweet testament to the complexities of the heart. Do I Hear A Waltz? opened on Broadway on March 18, 1965 at the 46th Street Theatre and closed on September 25, 1965 after 220 performances. It starred Elizabeth Allen and Sergio Franchi; other principal cast members included Carol Bruce, Madeleine Sherwood, Julienne Marie, Stuart Damon, Fleury D'Antonakis, and Jack Manning.",

Ahead of its time theatrically, Allegro remains timeless in its appeal.Allegro opened on Broadway at the Majestic Theatre on Ocotber 10, 1947, featuring John Battles as Joseph Taylor, Jr., Annamary Dickey asMajorie Taylor, William Ching as Dr. Joseph Taylor, Roberta Jonay as JennieBrinker, Lisa Kirk as Emily, and John Conte as Charlie Townsend.",

A historical fantasia in four parts, First Daughter Suite follows Patricia Nixon and daughters Tricia and Julie, Rosalynn and Amy Carter, Betty and Susan Ford, Patti Davis and mom Nancy Reagan, and Barbara Bush and daughter-in-law Laura as they strive to live meaningful lives in the public eye, while dealing with the complex private relationships all of us face with our parents and children. This wholly captivating musical with a lush, sweeping score is a deeply felt new work about mothers, daughters and the surprising discoveries we make about one another as we grow.",

The celebrity’s arrival at Winsocki Military Academy causes much excitement, and Bud abandons his girlfriend Helen Schlessinger to accompany the star to the ball. Out of jealousy, Helen damages the actress’s sash during the dance, and when other students see a chance to get a celebrity souvenir, chaos ensues.

    "plot": "In the late 1940s, Stine, a bookish writer of detective stories, struggles to adapt his crime novel into a workable screenplay. As Stine tries to maintain some integrity in the backstabbing world of Hollywood, his protagonist, a hardboiled private eye named Stone, fights for survival in a city full of criminals and opportunists. In a clever design choice, the stories are told on a split stage: Stine’s world is in full color, while Stone’s appears in black and white. With wit, humor, and a fantastic Cy Coleman score, City of Angels captures the snappy dialogue of a Raymond Chandler novel and the glitzy showmanship of classic Hollywood; the result is a crowd-pleasing musical unlike any other.City of Angels opened on Broadway at the Virginia Theatre on December 11, 1989, starring Gregg Edelman, James Naughton, Kay McClelland and Randy Graff. The show won six Tony Awards, including Best Musical, and played for 879 performances.",
