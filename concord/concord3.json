In this hilarious satire of musical theatre, one story becomes five delightful musicals, each written in the distinctive style of a different master of the form, from Rodgers and Hammerstein to Stephen Sondheim. The basic plot: June is an ingenue who can't pay the rent and is threatened by her evil landlord. Will the handsome leading man come to the rescue? The variations are: a Rodgers & Hammerstein version, set in Kansas in August, complete with a dream ballet; a Sondheim version, featuring the landlord as a tortured artistic genius who slashes the throats of his tenants in revenge for not appreciating his work; a Jerry Herman version, as a splashy star vehicle; an Andrew Lloyd Webber version, a rock musical with themes borrowed from Puccini; and a Kander & Ebb version, set in a speakeasy in Chicago.",

Young Marcel, the hero, irrationally believes that Albertine is having lesbian affairs while older Marcel (played by a different actor), reflects on this seminal period in his young life interacting with himself at 17. Simple lullabies and children's songs reflecting Marcel's childish character before his affair are juxtaposed with operatic dirges, capturing the tragic effect of his self-inflicted destruction of happiness. This fascinating play preserves both the essence and themes of Proust's work.",

    "plot": "From the pages of Steinbeck, the drifters and dropouts along Cannery Row spring to life in this uncommon story of love and hope. When Suzy, a homeless girl, is picked up for stealing food, she's taken in by Fauna, the big-hearted Madam of the Bear Flag Café (which is no café at all). Here she meets Doc, a carefree marine biologist, and soon romance is in the air. Rodgers & Hammerstein struck a new tone with Pipe Dream: warm and highly personal. It illuminates Rodgers & Hammerstein’s benevolence for outcasts who are infinitely capable of every emotion and longing felt by the more fortunate members of society.",

From young newbie to seasoned grand dame, the Queens strut their stuff in song and dance to prove \"I Got All of the Talent I Need.\" For 90 minutes of hilarious musical mayhem, they take the audience into the world of no-budget movies with awful scripts, fake monsters and gooey \"Special FX.\" They even involve the audience in a screaming contest and zombie talent search. As each Queen reveals her personal story, we share their hopes and dreams, from Tonya's love of her idol "Fay Wray" to Alexis' advice that "Everybody Starts at the Bottom" to DeeDee's secrets of Scream Queen longevity: "Don't Open That Door." British screen veteran Nadine savors her joy of being "Still In Demand" while Bianca celebrates the lifetime achievements of "Roger Corman" and Richelle laments her own elusive "Happy Endings." They also screen original clips from their direct-to-video \"scary movie\" spoofs such as \"Revenge of the Psycho Bimbos\" and \"Malibu Vampire Vixens\" all hoping to attract the attention of a popular young horror film director lurking in the audience.",

Princesses came from far and wide to win the hand of the prince, but none could pass the impossible tests given to them by the Queen. That is, until the “shy” swamp princess, Winnifred the Woebegone, showed up. Would she be able to pass the Sensitivity Test, marry her prince and help Lady Larkin and Sir Harry to the altar?

    "plot": "From their first hit song in 1925 through their final show-stopper in 1943, the prolific team of Rodgers & Hart was continually redefining the musical theatre with its wit, freshness and intelligence. In this rousing pastiche, the first act sets the stage for romance while the second act is comprised of their more satiric gems. The brief narration highlights the Rodgers & Hart story, but it's the songs that explain their success. Perhaps master tunesmith Irving Berlin summed it up best: \"Tuneful and tasty, schmaltzy and smart - music by Rodgers, lyrics by Hart.\"",

It contains some of Lloyd Webber’s most appealing songs: \“Tell Me on a Sunday,\” \“Come Back with the Same Look in Your Eyes,\” \“Unexpected Song\” and \“Nothing Like You’ve Ever Known.\”\nThe second act is a dance concert, set to Lloyd Webber’s Variations.

It was subsequently presented by Chicago Shakespeare Theater in May 2004. The cast included Nicole Parker (Mad-TV, Wicked), Keegan-Michael Key (Key and Peele), and Brian Gallivan (Sassy Gay Friend).",
