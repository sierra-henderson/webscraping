The story of Zorba, the Greek, carefree vagabond and his chosen friend and master, unworldly Nikos; the romance of Zorba and the aging courtesan Madame Hortense and of Nikos and the withdrawn, beautiful widow; a mine disaster, murder, suicide, a blood feud—Zorba! has all the ingredients that make for dramatically engaging theatre. The powerful score from the composers of Cabaret and  Kiss of the SpiderWoman includes Life Is, No Boom-Boom, The Butterfly and I Am Free. Compelling music and a rousing story make Zorba! an outstanding opportunity for musical theatre performers and audiences alike.Zorba! was first presented on Broadway at the Imperial Theatre in November 1968.",

When she asks who he is and the first words he utters are “Jesus Christ,” it’s as if all her prayers have been answered.\nSwallow and the town’s other children vow to protect the stranger from the world that waits outside—the townspeople who are determined to catch a fugitive hiding in their midst. As fantasy and reality collide, Swallow is torn between the two and begins to discover who she is and where she is going.",

Brilliant innovators with humble roots, both were masters of self-invention who sacrificed everything to become the country’s first major female entrepreneurs. They were also fierce competitors whose fifty-year tug-of-war would give birth to an industry. From Fifth Avenue society to the halls of Congress, their rivalry was relentless and legendary – pushing both women to build international empires in a world dominated by men.",
