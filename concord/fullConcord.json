The actual teachings of The Church of Scientology are explained and dissected against the candy-colored backdrop of a traditional nativity play. Pageant is a musical biography of the life of L. Ron Hubbard, with child-friendly explanations of Hubbard's notion of the divided mind (embodied by the lovely identical twins Emma and Sophie Whitfield in matching brain outfits) and a device called the e-meter (or electropsychometer), used to monitor the human psyche, which is demonstrated by stick puppets. Grade school children, portraying Tom Cruise, Kirstie Alley, John Travolta, and other less starry Scientologists, brings the controversial Church of Scientology to jubilant life in story and song.",

As Stine tries to maintain some integrity in the backstabbing world of Hollywood, his protagonist, a hardboiled private eye named Stone, fights for survival in a city full of criminals and opportunists. In a clever design choice, the stories are told on a split stage: Stine’s world is in full color, while Stone’s appears in black and white. With wit, humor, and a fantastic Cy Coleman score, City of Angels captures the snappy dialogue of a Raymond Chandler novel and the glitzy showmanship of classic Hollywood; the result is a crowd-pleasing musical unlike any other.City of Angels opened on Broadway at the Virginia Theatre on December 11, 1989, starring Gregg Edelman, James Naughton, Kay McClelland and Randy Graff.

    "plot": "Leona, an unmarried American secretary 'of a certain age,' goes on a vacation to Venice where, under the spell of that enchanted city, she falls in love. The gentleman is an attractive, middle-aged shopkeeper, whose attentions give flight to her deepest dreams of romance. Too soon, however, he openly informs her that he is a contented family man, and Leona's hopes are dashed. She can, for a short time, harness romance, yet realizes that such a relationship would have nowhere to go. Still, might it be better than never having loved at all? This timeless story, whichwas also the basis of the movie Summertime starring Katharine Hepburn, remains a bittersweet testament to the complexities of the heart. Do I Hear A Waltz? opened on Broadway on March 18, 1965 at the 46th Street Theatre and closed on September 25, 1965 after 220 performances. It starred Elizabeth Allen and Sergio Franchi; other principal cast members included Carol Bruce, Madeleine Sherwood, Julienne Marie, Stuart Damon, Fleury D'Antonakis, and Jack Manning.",

Presided over by the enigmatic Dr. Selavy (or C'est La Vie, if you like), himself an illusion created by master trickster Marcel Duchamp, this outrageous journey leads our hero in an ironic dance through an eccentric fun house of extravagant awakenings to a climax of self-knowledge and acceptance. To the strains of an eminently hummable and upbeat score, this off-beat piece provides an adventurous departure from the traditional expectations of musical theatre.",

When the error is discovered, heads roll and the completed film is shelved. But Rudolf, the nephew of studio head Lionel Z. Governor, takes a liking to Hope and arranges for a sneak preview. The movie - surprisingly - is a success, and Hope becomes a star.Fade Out - Fade In opened on Broadway at the Mark Hellinger Theatre on May 26, 1964, starring Carol Burnett as Hope, Dick Patterson as Rudolf, and Lou Jacobi as Lionel Z. Governor. The show was a huge critical success, but the production staggered when Ms. Burnett was injured in a taxi cab accident, forcing the production to close for three months. The show reopened on February 15, 1965, but it never fully recovered from the break. Closing shortly thereafter, Fade Out- Fade In played a total of 271 performances.",

In San Francisco's Chinatown of the late '50s, nightclub owner Sammy Fong's traditional family has ordered him a picture-bride from China, hoping to end his pursuit of an enticing dancer. Mei Li arrives, shy and at sea in a world she doesn't understand, and it's clear that she's the wrong gal for the assimilated Sammy. However, Mei Li may be just the ticket for Sammy's buddy Wang Ta, whose traditionalist father is fighting a losing battle with his kids against rock 'n' roll, baseball, and other trappings of the modern American lifestyle. By turns raucous and heartfelt, this delightful Chinese puzzle of embracing the new while honoring the old is a celebration of American ingenuity.",

The score, which hilariously incorporates themes by Franz Liszt and Jacques Offenbach, features a string of delightful Jule Styne/Sammy Cahn numbers, including “Papa, Won’t You Dance With Me?,” “I Still Get Jealous,” and “On A Sunday By The Sea” (a.k.a. “The Bathing Beauty Ballet”). High Button Shoes opened on Broadway at the New Century Theatre on October 9, 1947, starring Phil Silvers and Nanette Fabray. The show later moved to the Shubert Theatre and the Broadway Theatre, playing for a total of 727 performances.",

She takes us back to relive familial hardships and triumphs including the near loss of their home, Papa's desperate return to Norway when he can no longer find work, and the sale of her first story-this one.

When Senator Loganberry arrives in the Big Easy to investigate the dubious doings at the Louisiana Purchasing Company, it isn't long before he's set up for plenty of scandal himself. In his review of the recent Carnegie Hall concert - the first time the musical had been seen or heard since its original Broadway run - New York Times critic Lawrence Van Gelder posited, 'Does the South still produce corrupt Democratic politicians and businessmen? Are there still Republican senators eager to expose them to further their own Presidential ambitions? Is sex still a weapon in these wars?' Louisiana Purchase answers these questions with a gleeful wink of the eye and a score full of Berlin magic!",

In this hilarious satire of musical theatre, one story becomes five delightful musicals, each written in the distinctive style of a different master of the form, from Rodgers and Hammerstein to Stephen Sondheim. The basic plot: June is an ingenue who can't pay the rent and is threatened by her evil landlord. Will the handsome leading man come to the rescue? The variations are: a Rodgers & Hammerstein version, set in Kansas in August, complete with a dream ballet; a Sondheim version, featuring the landlord as a tortured artistic genius who slashes the throats of his tenants in revenge for not appreciating his work; a Jerry Herman version, as a splashy star vehicle; an Andrew Lloyd Webber version, a rock musical with themes borrowed from Puccini; and a Kander & Ebb version, set in a speakeasy in Chicago.",

Young Marcel, the hero, irrationally believes that Albertine is having lesbian affairs while older Marcel (played by a different actor), reflects on this seminal period in his young life interacting with himself at 17. Simple lullabies and children's songs reflecting Marcel's childish character before his affair are juxtaposed with operatic dirges, capturing the tragic effect of his self-inflicted destruction of happiness. This fascinating play preserves both the essence and themes of Proust's work.",

    "plot": "Inspired by the original 1936 film of the same name, this raucous musical comedy takes a tongue-in-cheek look at the hysteria caused when clean-cut kids fall prey to marijuana, leading them on a hysterical downward spiral filled with evil jazz music, sex and violence. You won't be able to resist the spoofy fun of Reefer Madness. The addictive, clever musical numbers range from big Broadway-style showstoppers to swing tunes like 'Down at the Ol' Five and Dime' and the Vegas-style 'Listen to Jesus, Jimmy,' featuring J.C. Himself leading a chorus of showgirl angels. Refeer Madness is a highly stylized and satirical political commentary that will leave you wanting more.",

His gambling continues as his debts compound, and soon he deserts her and their young daughter. A subplot concerns the potential arrest of Magnolia's selfless best friend on charges of miscegenation when it's discovered that she is of mixed race, and her subsequent downward spiral into despair. The passing of time reunites Magnolia and her now-grown daughter with her family on the show boat as well as with her husband, who eventually returns offering a hopeful second chance at familial fulfillment.",

It was created using the following formula: Troubled teenagers + feuding families + political intrigue = musical comedy.  The show, a smash hit for Chicago Shakespeare Theater, is the funniest mash up of Shakespeare, Gilbert & Sullivan, sketch comedy, and American theater you've ever seen.IMPORTANT: While all audiences will enjoy the play, it includes some strong language some producers may be uncomfortable with, so the authors have provided an appendix to the script wherein the coarser language has been redacted.The People vs. Friar Laurence was first presented by David Castellani at the Tamarind Theater in Los Angeles in January 2004. It was subsequently presented by Chicago Shakespeare Theater in May 2004. The cast included Nicole Parker (Mad-TV, Wicked), Keegan-Michael Key (Key and Peele), and Brian Gallivan (Sassy Gay Friend).",

She is defended by Jim Summerford, a Southern gentleman who’s never won a case against prosecutor and Mayoral candidate Mavis Frye—his fiancé. As Jim tries to prove Mona’s innocence, he becomes attracted to her, and Mavis ups the stakes: she wants to convict Mona, marry Jim, take office, tear down the Frog Pad, and put up a Casino—bringing in bucks, but taking away Tippo’s artistic and social traditions in the process. And if Mona is found guilty, the odds are Mavis will get her way.",

When midnight debauchery leads to tragedy at dawn, the high-flying characters land with a sobering thud, reminding us that no party lasts forever.",

How do we hold on to our childhood dreams and ideals as adult disillusionment sets in? How do we sustain life as artists without settling for others’ definitions of success? And how do we recover when we lose those battles?  This new theatrical song cycle was born of Drew Gasparini’s journey forging a creative path and navigating the world at large, and his desire to offer empathy and hope to everyone doing the same.",
