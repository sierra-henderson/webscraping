The plot is a little bit of everything: Colorado Rangers led by stalwart Captain Jim; the lovely Mary Sunshine and her “naughty” maid Nancy; a chorus of giggling schoolgirls; and the ominous but benevolent Indian chief. Hearts are won and lost and won again in this delightful, laugh-filled, and charming show.Little Mary Sunshine first appeared on November 18, 1959 at the Orpheum Theatre in New York City's.

Mei Li arrives, shy and at sea in a world she doesn't understand, and it's clear that she's the wrong gal for the assimilated Sammy. However, Mei Li may be just the ticket for Sammy's buddy Wang Ta, whose traditionalist father is fighting a losing battle with his kids against rock 'n' roll, baseball, and other trappings of the modern American lifestyle. By turns raucous and heartfelt, this delightful Chinese puzzle of embracing the new while honoring the old is a celebration of American ingenuity.",

Hope Springfield, an ebullient movie house usherette with no talent for performing, accidentally gets the starring role in a new movie. When the error is discovered, heads roll and the completed film is shelved. But Rudolf, the nephew of studio head Lionel Z. Governor, takes a liking to Hope and arranges for a sneak preview. The movie - surprisingly - is a success, and Hope becomes a star.Fade Out - Fade In opened on Broadway at the Mark Hellinger Theatre on May 26, 1964, starring Carol Burnett as Hope, Dick Patterson as Rudolf, and Lou Jacobi as Lionel Z. Governor. The show was a huge critical success, but the production staggered when Ms. Burnett was injured in a taxi cab accident, forcing the production to close for three months. The show reopened on February 15, 1965, but it never fully recovered from the break. Closing shortly thereafter, Fade Out- Fade In played a total of 271 performances.",

In his review of the recent Carnegie Hall concert - the first time the musical had been seen or heard since its original Broadway run - New York Times critic Lawrence Van Gelder posited, 'Does the South still produce corrupt Democratic politicians and businessmen? Are there still Republican senators eager to expose them to further their own Presidential ambitions? Is sex still a weapon in these wars?'

Set in San Francisco following the turn of the century, this story of a Norwegian family's survival in the New World is told in retrospect by the eldest daughter, a successful writer recounting the start of her career and the childhood that inspired it. She takes us back to relive familial hardships and triumphs including the near loss of their home, Papa's desperate return to Norway when he can no longer find work, and the sale of her first story-this one. But, of course, it's Mama she remembers most of all, always guiding their precarious journey with a firm hand and a warm heart.",

Contrasting the swinging, jazzy rhythms of big city business with the earthy, traditional sounds of the characters’ Eastern European origins, I Can Get It For You Wholesale captures the energy and promise of a pivotal time in Jewish American history.I Can Get It For You Wholesale opened on Broadway at the Shubert Theatre on March 22, 1962, starring Elliott Gould, Lilian Roth and Marilyn Cooper. The show transferred to the Broadway Theatre and ran for a total of 300 performances.

    "plot": "This show-within-a-show follows the romance between a chorus girl and an assistant stage manager leading to their secret marriage. Their happy union is threatened by the electrician who still carries a torch for the girl and, in a drunken rage, tries to kill them both. A contrasting romance involves the stage manager, whose credo never to fall for a girl in a show he's working on is complicated when a dancer he's been wooing is suddenly thrown into the cast of 'Me and Juliet.' Informed by rich insights into the world of Broadway-how jobs are gotten and lost, the inside tricks of the trade and the pitfalls of backstage romances - Me and Juliet is an innovative, irresistible show that consistently delivers both musically and dramatically.Me and Juliet opened on Broadway at the Majestic Theatre on May 28, 1953, featuring Isabel Bigley, Bill Hayes and Joan McCracken.",
