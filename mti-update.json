In the style of movies such as Back to the Future, Ferris Bueller's Day Off and The Karate Kid, Back to the 80's is a nostalgic romp through the greatest hits of the decade.",
      "Back to the 80's tells the story of the senior class of William Ocean High School, as remembered through the eyes of now thirty-something Corey Palmer. Seventeen-year-old Corey is madly in love with his next-door neighbor, Tiffany Houston, one of the coolest girls in the school, but she is too busy mooning over Michael Feldman, the hottest guy around. Michael and his friends are athletic and good looking — the kind of guys that Corey and his two best friends dream of being. However, while they may not be the coolest guys in school, they are still one up on Feargal McFerrin, III, whose best friend is his computer and who believes the crazy notion that one day, CDs will replace cassette tapes.",
      "Throw in a Star Wars dream sequence, high-energy dance routines, the obligatory 80s party scene, copious amounts of blue eyeshadow, twenty cans of hairspray, as well as some of the most popular songs ever written, and the result is a musical that will not only delight and amuse audiences of any age, but will also inspire any young cast. Back to the 80's is a high-energy musical with contemporary flair that will certainly fill the seats."

The cast features a soaring soprano ingenue, parts for young performers and children, and one of the musical theatre's treasures, a tour de force leading role for a charismatic actor who doesn't need to be a trained singer."

Featuring an infectious score by the Oscar- and Tony-winning team of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, Little Shop of Horrors), God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is a legendary collaboration between one of America's greatest novelists and the songwriting team behind some of the greatest hits of all time.",
      "Eliot Rosewater, drunk, volunteer fireman and president of the fabulously rich Rosewater Foundation, is about to attempt a noble experiment with human nature, with a little help from writer, Kilgore Trout. The result is Vonnegut's funniest satire, an etched-in-acid portrayal of the greed, hypocrisy and follies of the flesh to which we are all heir.",
      "Any fan of the music of Menken and Ashman will delight in producing this gem, which marked the first collaboration for the two. Full of unforgettable characters and a rich and hysterically funny story, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is a perfect choice for theatres that are looking for hidden greats of musical theatre.",

Adapted from Kurt Vonnegut's novella, it tells the story of Elliot Rosewater, the eccentric head of the Rosewater Foundation, son of Senator Rosewater, descendant of generations of wealthy and powerful Rosewater's, who finds in the poor and forgotten Americans in Rosewater Township, Indiana, the very people who most deserve his foundation's generosity. And that story struck a deep chord in both Howard and me. The fact that Kurt Vonnegut himself became creatively involved in our little musical was a total dream-come-true.",

It was the cradle from which we emerged to write Little Shop of Horrors, The Little Mermaid and Aladdin . We lost Howard Ashman way too soon, or that list of titles would have been much longer. That makes it all the more meaningful to me that, nearly 40 years after its creation, God Bless You Mr Rosewater now joins those other titles out in the world.\"",

      "In Follies, the time is 1971, and theatrical impresario, Dimitri Weissmann, hosts a reunion of ex-Follies performers in his crumbling theatre, setting the stage for a parade of brilliant pastiche numbers, including \"Losing My Mind,\" \"I'm Still Here\" and \"Broadway Baby.\" Amid the reminiscing, two middle-aged couples confront some unpleasant truths about their past and present, coming face-to-face with the future.",
      "Follies is a true showcase for powerful dramatic actors with plenty of opportunities for seasoned, older performers. Spectacular and grand in scale, Follies has also proven ideal for concert presentation and features many of Stephen Sondheim's best-known songs."

Thanks to his new friends, Maggie and Henry, Jack finds nothing to fear about the water, but not before the chilling revelation of his aversion's origination. Unfortunately, Jack has little time to bask in the glory of his aquatic achievement, for tragedy is soon to befall him and his family.",

An outstanding choice for a group or company looking for unique period pieces, this musical successfully transports audiences to a time in history commonly underrepresented in musical theatre, and has the potential to come to engaging life on nearly any size of stage."

Filled with foot-stomping, toe-tapping songs by Don Schlitz (\"The Gambler\") and with a book by Ken Ludwig, this musical adventure is a tale of thrilling escapes, comedy and inspiration for the whole family.",
      "Set in 1840 Missouri, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is the tale of young Tom Sawyer and the neverending mischief of which he so often finds himself a part; whether it's matching wits with Aunt Polly, tricking his friends into whitewashing a fence for him or narrowly escaping the clutches of a murderous villain. Along with his best friend, Huckleberry Finn, and his love interest, Becky Thatcher, the greatest Tom Sawyer exploits are plucked from the book and plopped onto the stage.",
      "Aside from having one of the most recognizable titles from literary history, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a superb family-friendly show. The large and flexible cast size, not to mention the potential for tying its presentation into English curricula, makes it an exemplary choice for schools. This also serves as a great opportunity to showcase your male talent."

      "Reminiscent of such great \"Broadway operas\" as Candide, Porgy and Bess and Street Scene, Magdalena features challenging and beautiful solo and choral work for a cast of trained \"legit\" singers, in an enthralling epic that spans the globe from the cafes of Paris to the lush jungles of South America. Like Kismet, its soaring, classically based score makes it an ideal show for opera companies, symphony orchestras (in concert presentation) or any group catering to an audience of classical music lovers."

Elsewhere, the brilliant and fearless young Melchior interrupts a mind-numbing Latin drill to defend his buddy, Moritz – a boy so traumatized by puberty that he can't concentrate on anything... not that the Headmaster cares.

One afternoon, in a private place in the woods, Melchior and Wendla meet by accident and soon find within themselves a desire unlike anything they've ever felt. As they fumble their way into one another's arms, Moritz flounders and soon fails out of school. When even his one adult friend, Melchior's mother, ignores his plea for help, he is left so distraught that he can't hear the promise of life offered by his outcast friend, Ilse. Naturally, the Headmasters waste no time in pinning the \"crime\" of Moritz's suicide on Melchior to expel him. And soon, Mama learns that her little Wendla is pregnant. Now the young lovers must struggle against all odds to build a world together for their child.",

As with all of Sondheim and Lapine's works, Passion requires (and highlights) a cast of accomplished singing actors."

      "A phenomenal swordsman, a born leader and an artistic, intelligent poet with the ability to enchant the hardest of souls, Cyrano is plagued with one tragic flaw – a nose that is bigger than can ever be imagined. He never comes to terms with his looks or how he thinks he appears to the woman whom he secretly loves, the beautiful Roxana; thus, when she tells him of her interest in the handsome yet inarticulate soldier, Christian, Cyrano helps the young man, acting as his muse and penning eloquent love letters that win her over.",
      "A lavish addition to any season with soaring ballads and rousing word- and sword-play, Cyrano is an ideal star vehicle to boot. Christopher Plummer won the Tony Award in 1974 for his portrayal of the legendary swordsman."

She, too, bears a barrage of misfortunes, including — but not limited to — sale into prostitution, forced marriage to an exorbitantly wealthy man and slavery. Through it all, however, they try to remember the lessons of their dear master, Dr. Pangloss: \"Everything is for the best in this best of all possible worlds.\"",

Scenically it can be as grand or as simple as the designer sees fit and, likewise, requires a cast of only moderate size that can be easily expanded to accommodate the grandest of ensembles. Candide is the ideal blend of sophisticated operetta and wacky Python-esque comedy, and will surely thrill a wide range of theatergoers."

Weill's greatest theatre songs are presented in a fluid blend of music and story, spanning twenty eventful years, from Von Hindenburg and Hitler in Germany to Roosevelt and Truman in the U.S.",
      "Greeted and ushered along by a charming Guide, audiences are invited to board the musical vessel that is Kurt Weill's rise to international acclaim. Setting sail in 1920s Berlin, Mr. Weill's cross-continental and international travels are described with immaculately crafted narration, surrounded by the composer's most noteworthy works. Selections from more than a dozen of Weill's pieces — including The Threepenny Opera, Knickerbocker Holiday and Lost in the Stars — are chronologically performed while Weill's partnerships — both musical and romantic — are dissected. An intoxicating retrospective, Berlin to Broadway with Kurt Weill perfectly fills Weill connoisseurs' cravings and sends those otherwise unfamiliar with his work, away from the theatre with an appreciation for the musical genius that is Kurt Weill.",
      "Berlin to Broadway with Kurt Weill provides nearly limitless artistic opportunities. Ranging from creative integration of multimedia, various scenic choices that might be suggestive of multiple periods, or even a simple and intimate evening, the design options are vast in scope. It's also the perfect chance to feature a small cast of \"All-Star\" performers of which a theatre company's subscription base is especially fond."

Young Cal Chandler can't even fathom the twists and turns that this political roller coaster to which his mother and uncle are strapping him will take.

As originally staged by the legendary Jerome Robbins, the show is an impressive showcase for accomplished dancers (a guide featuring the original choreography is available for rental). And, with a reduced orchestration and transpositions on demand, this masterpiece is easier to mount than ever before!"

Join Amalia and Georg to discover the identity of their true loves... and of all the twists and turns along the way!",

Traveling in time from 1960 to 1970, SHOUT! chronicles the dawning liberation of women, from the rise of Dusty Springfield, Petula Clark and Cilla Black as independent women with major careers, to their American counterparts, redefining themselves in the face of changing attitudes about gender. With a shimmy and shake, the songs are tied together by hilarious sound bites from the period – from '60s advertisements to letters answered by an advice columnist who thinks that every problem can be solved with a \"fetching new hair style and a new shade of lipstick.\"",

But now it's here, brimming with all of the charm and youthful vitality of a talent blossoming into greatness.",

Unfortunately, one of them, Gene, is so eager to climb the social ladder and impress his sweetheart that he invests his friends' money in a swank apartment near the Brooklyn Bridge, even going so far as to sell the gang's precious automobile!",

Saturday Night is a nostalgic charmer that will appeal to every audience and is a must for Sondheim fans."

As he makes new friends (and a couple of enemies), Arthur learns to stand up for himself and helps others learn the importance of self-reliance and commitment to ones’ principles and passions.",

It follows seven archetypal characters – the charismatic leading man, the sly harlequin, the quack doctor, the old miser, the voluptuous leading lady, the devoted dwarf and the elegant Moon Woman – as they search for immortality and love. In their search for glory and fame, the characters are thrown out of France by the religious court because of their \"lewd\" performances.

      "From the writers behind A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum comes the hilarious send up of Greek comedy and satire, The Frogs. Loosely based on a comedy written in 405 B.C. by Aristophanes, The Frogs playfully explores the great challenges of human existence: confronting our fears, understanding life and death and challenging the distractions that can prevent us from achieving our goals.",
      "This boisterously hilarious, yet poignant, musical follows Dionysos, Greek god of wine and drama, and his slave, Xanthias, on a journey to Hades to collect renowned critic and playwright, George Bernard Shaw, so that he may enlighten the easily misled and coerced masses of Earth. Along this journey, Dionysus and Xanthias meet Chekhov, Congreve, Ibsen, Brecht and, of course, the chorus of frogs. Then, Shakespeare shows up and starts declaiming his greatest hits; before long, he engages in a battle of words with Mr. Shaw. Who will win the honor of becoming reincarnated: The Bard or Bernard?",
      "The Frogs stays true to its heritage, mixing Aristophanic pratfall satire with a Sondheim score that swings from witty to pretty to rambunctious, but it also mirrors the Greek original for the serious issue of the role of the arts in a world beset by war and folly. This musical is ideal for a regional theatre looking to inject a bit of Greek satire into its season."

Weaving together the work of legendary songwriters such as Hoagy Carmichael, Frank Loesser, Duke Ellington, Johnny Mercer, Cab Calloway and the Gershwins, the story moves through time and place to highlight a slick slice of yesteryear and capture a beloved American era.",

Presenting their stories with various styles of dance, including jazz, contemporary and musical theatre tap, Coda and the company of The All Night Strut! A Jumpin' Jivin' Jam eventually bid adieu and disappear into the recesses of the wonder that is our imagination, but not before having a \"jumpin' & jivin' good time!\"",

Doctorow's distinguished novel, Ragtime is the winner of the 1998 Tony Awards for Best Score, Book and Orchestrations, and both the Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle Awards for Best Musical and Best Score. Called by TIME Magazine \"A triumph for the stage,\" and by the International Herald Tribune \"the best musical in twenty years,\" this acclaimed musical is filled with pageantry, emotion and hope, bursting onto the stage like no other musical.",
      "At the dawn of a new century, everything is changing... and anything is possible. Set in the volatile melting pot of turn-of-the-century New York, three distinctly American tales are woven together – that of a stifled upper-class wife, a determined Jewish immigrant and a daring young Harlem musician – united by their courage, compassion and belief in the promise of the future. Together, they confront history's timeless contradictions of wealth and poverty, freedom and prejudice, hope and despair... and what it means to live in America.",
      "The Tony-winning score is just as diverse as the melting pot of America itself, drawing upon many musical styles, from the ragtime rhythms of Harlem and Tin Pan Alley to the klezmer of the Lower East Side, from bold brass band marches to delicate waltzes, from up-tempo banjo tunes to period parlor songs and expansive anthems. A truly unique and powerful portrait of America, Ragtime is sure to inspire actors and audiences alike!"

As the girl wins the affection of the other boarders, she draws the ire of Miss Minchin, the dour headmistress, who forces Sara to work as a maid when her father is reported dead, and his fortune is seized. Sara counters all of Miss Minchin's best efforts to degrade her, all the while maintaining the grace and virtue of a little princess.",

Because of its strong curriculum tie-ins, A Little Princess provides a wonderful opportunity for theatre companies to team up with schools in their area for workshops, talkbacks and more."

He disavows the pirates' way of life and falls for the beautiful Mabel. Frederic's melodious tones win over the heart of Major-General Stanley's songbird daughter, Mabel, but when the Pirate King discovers that General Stanley has lied about being an orphan to keep the pirates from stealing all of his belongings and carrying off his bevy of beautiful daughters, an \"ingenious paradox\" may prevent the budding romance and lead to the death of \"The very model of a modern Major-General.\"",

The sheer number of memorable roles makes it perfect for community and school groups. And with production requirements consisting of only two sets and a medium-sized orchestra, The Pirates of Penzance should be considered by any company featuring comic actors with excellent singing voices."

Scared to let her go, though, the witch reneges. Lucky for Rapunzel a young Prince named Brian happens across her tower and calls out to her, as he's seen the witch do: \"Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let down your hair!\" Before the Prince and Rapunzel have their inevitable \"happily ever after,\" though, they're going to have to face the wrath of the witch and a few other hilarious obstacles.",
      "A small cast size and easy-to-conquer technical demands, Rapunzel is a wonderful choice for any theatre company whose audience is comprised of families. It would be a great show to produce as a small touring production presented to local schools. Bottom line: Rapunzel is a glittering gem of theatrical goodness."

At sea, the boys are discovered by a precocious young girl named Molly, a Starcatcher-in-training who realizes that the trunk’s precious cargo is starstuff, a celestial substance so powerful that it must never fall into the wrong hands. When the ship is taken over by pirates – led by the fearsome Black Stache, a villain determined to claim the trunk and its treasure for his own – the journey quickly becomes a thrilling adventure.",

      "Melvin Ferd, the Third, wants to clean up Tromaville, the most polluted town in New Jersey (just off Exit 13B on the Turnpike). Foiled by the mayor's bullies, Melvin is dumped into a vat of radioactive toxic waste, only to reemerge as The Toxic Avenger, New Jersey's first superhero. Affectionately known as Toxie, our new hero is a seven-foot mutant freak with superhuman strength and a heart as big as Newark. He's out to save New Jersey, end global warming, and woo the blind librarian in town.",

Finally, during the Paris student uprising of 1832, Javert must confront his ideals after Valjean spares his life and saves that of the student revolutionary who has captured the heart of Valjean's adopted daughter. His world view shattered, Javert commits suicide, and Valjean finally attains the peace that he has sought for so long.",

The sung-through pop opera is ideal for a cast of exceptional singers and overflows with melodies that are already standards. A spectacle on Broadway and in London, Les Misérables is equally effective with a minimal set; it is its powerful affirmation of the human spirit that has made Les Misérables a popular masterpiece."

Together, they confront history's timeless contradictions of wealth and poverty, freedom and prejudice, hope and despair, and what it means to live in America.",

A truly unique and powerful portrait of America, Ragtime is sure to inspire actors and audiences alike!"

Unremarkable though they may be, these hardy Biblical bystanders somehow survive calamity after calamity in outrageous fashion, inventing some useful and practical devices along the way (for example, the Life Saver... candy), escaping enslavement in ancient Egypt and helping a young man named Cain find his redemption.",

However, the revised version of the show that was remounted at Capital Repertory Theatre in 2007 is included in the rehearsal set as optional/revised material.

Although Horton faces ridicule, danger, kidnapping and a trial, the intrepid Gertrude McFuzz never loses faith in him.

Building upon the characters and songs from Forever Plaid, The Sound of Plaid features a flexible cast size made up of both male and female performers.",
      "The premise of The Sound of Plaid is similar to Forever Plaid: In 1960s America, friends who met in the audiovisual club form a student choral group. When they discover that their high school music program was going to be cut from the curriculum, they decide to do a benefit to raise money. On the way to pick up their custom made plaid tuxedos and skirts, their bus is struck by lightning. Although The Sound of Plaid members are taken from this planet, through the Power of Harmony and the Expanding Holes in the Ozone Layer (and other astro-technical stuff), they are allowed to come back to perform the show that they never got to do in life.",
      "Featuring classic songs and warm, funny characters, The Sound of Plaid is a great new twist on a familiar favorite, and a perfect choice for any theatre looking to do a \"big, little show.\""
